# About the application

Laravel + Vue.js app for creating a movie list where you can keep track which movies you are currently watching / watched and lets you rate them.

## Project setup

Make sure [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop 'Docker dekstop') is installed on your machine if you are using windows or mac, or docker-compose if you are using linux.

### Configuring Laradock

2. Update your env file with the following:

   ```
   WORKSPACE_INSTALL_MONGO=true
   PHP_FPM_INSTALL_MONGO=true
   ```

3. If you are using <b>Windows</b> you need to change the value of `DATA_PATH_HOST` variable to `/Users/yourWindowsUserName/.laradock/data` otherwise the mongo container will not start

4. If you want to use XDEBUG then set the `PHP_FPM_INSTALL_XDEBUG` variable to `true`
